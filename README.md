# Birthday Greetings Kata

An implementation of [Matteo Vaccai's Birthday Greetings Kata](http://matteo.vaccari.name/blog/archives/154).

## Learning Notes

- JavaScript practice

- How to structure an npm project?
  - Start w/ everything in one folder, *restructure later*.
  - Jest: How to import tests in 'src'?
  - Where is "main" for production use?
    - See the `main` property in `package.json`
- Using classes and dependency injection  
- How to read Files in Node?
  - What is a common abstraction for in-memory vs. files?


## To Dos

- Instead of using JS's `Date`, use another type that represents a calendar day and not a timestamp?
