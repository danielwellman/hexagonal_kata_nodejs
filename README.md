# Birthday Greetings Kata

An implementation of [Matteo Vaccai's Birthday Greetings Kata](http://matteo.vaccari.name/blog/archives/154).

## To Dos

- Implement an SMTP mail client adapter or decide (and document) why not...
- Implement a 'main' in `index.js` to show production use/wiring of the application
- Draw a picture of the ports and adapters and name them
- Brief overview in this README
- Fix any TODOs?
- Restructure into src/test folders
- Push to GitHub

Maybe:

- Contract tests for different adapters? (file system vs in memory repository, etc.)
- Instead of using JS's `Date`, use another type that represents a calendar day and not a timestamp?
