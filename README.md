# Birthday Greetings Kata

An implementation of [Matteo Vaccari's Birthday Greetings Kata](http://matteo.vaccari.name/blog/archives/154).

## To Dos

- Draw a picture of the ports and adapters and name them
- Brief overview in this README
- Fix any TODOs?
- Push to GitHub

Maybe:

- Contract tests for different adapters? (file system vs in memory repository, etc.)
- Fully implement the SmtpPostOffice using something like `nodemailer`  
- Instead of using JS's `Date`, use another type that represents a calendar day and not a timestamp?
